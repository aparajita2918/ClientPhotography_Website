            <p>This collaborative photographic documentary portrait project explores issues associated with being transgender in Scotland in 2019.
                The project initially started life with the working title ‘My Cup of Tea’, but as the project developed and my understanding of transgender issues grew, I felt this title didn't do justice to the project.
                It seemed inappropriate and casual. After meeting and subsequently photographing a broad variety of people, albeit united by a common theme, I felt the title of this project had to, in some way, embody what was contained within their testimonies and my images.
                <br>‘Beyond Gender’ whilst not perfect seemed a better way to encapsulate this project.

                The transgender community in India, where I am from, faces discrimination in terms of employment, access to housing, education, civil partnership, adoption and medical requirements like HIV care, mental health care, treatment for substance abuse, and other surgical needs.
                Whilst those from a more privileged background might find it easier to be accepted by mainstream society, for the majority, life can be very difficult.

                Through my research into the transgender community in Scotland, I noticed that, to a certain degree, and despite being considered a more developed country, particularly in terms of LGBT+ issues, many of the transgender people I spoke to had experienced similar problems to their counterparts in India.
                Intolerance, use of pronouns and subsequent ignorance towards the trans community, a lack of mental health support, a lack of doctors who perform surgery on transgender individuals, body and gender dysphoria, suicide and self harming.
                In addition to my photographs I have produced a small booklet which contains stories and some intimate testimonies from the participants which relate to the issues stated above.
                Whilst my images could be understood in isolation, the addition of the text which is transcribed from conversations, is intended to bring viewers closer to what it means to be transgender today.
                <br>
                Despite the difficulties and the challenges, I have enjoyed working with and learning from the participants and will forever be indebted to their generosity and patience. I want to continue working on this project when I return to India, and I’m looking forward to working with different communities and individuals and starting important conversations. I hope that my work might find a broad audience and in some way, make a difference. This project brought me a deeper understanding of the problems of the trans community and I’m honoured to have had the opportunity of working with such an engaged and brave group of individuals.</p>

            <p>I am the only child, I think that was also bit of a problem for my parents because you’ve got this plan of what your child is going to do and I didn’t really fit into that.
                They expect me to get married and be a straight girl with a husband and do all of those kind of things and I haven’t fit with that plan at all. I’m not going to be a woman, I’m not necessarily going to have a husband, or be a parent and that’s sometimes difficult for people to accept. </p>

            <p>I went to a Catholic secondary school in Ireland, so I had to wear uniform. We had to wear skirts, we had no option for trousers.
                After that I had a rebound stage where I was super butch.
                I shaved all my hair off, I was wearing all these baggy men’s clothes, gained a little weight.
                I think that was the first time, I said to someone that I was genderqueer. </p>
